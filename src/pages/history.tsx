        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Bob Zabel bought an existing monument company in Manitowoc in June of
          1970 and named it Zabel Monuments. Bob’s son, John, began working for
          his father immediately. John has taken several courses through the
          Elberton Granite Association in Georgia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bob was influential in forming the Wisconsin Association of Monument
          Builders (WAMB) and served as their President. John also worked his
          way through the WAMB board of directors serving several positions,
          including President from 1990-1992.
        </p>
        <p>John purchased the family business from his father in 1985.</p>
        <p>
          In 1989 Zabel Monuments expanded to Sheboygan by acquiring Modern
          Monuments. This acquisition established Zabel’s Modern Monuments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1996 following high school, John’s son Eric, joined the family
          business. Eric is a graduate of the Barre Granite Technical Program in
          Barre, Vermont. He is active in WAMB as well and has served several
          positions on the board of directors including President from
          2002-2004. This made Zabel Monuments the only firm in Wisconsin to
          have three generations serve as WAMB’s President.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eric completed the Certified Memorialist (CM) credential in 2005. This
          is the highest achievement in the memorial business. There are only
          109 CM’s in the United States with only 3 located here in Wisconsin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2012, Eric was invited to be a member of the American Institute of
          Commemorative Art (AICA). AICA consists of 55 of the best designers in
          North America. Membership is by invitation only. Eric is the only
          member of the Institute from Wisconsin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eric purchased the family business from his father in 2014 starting
          the 3rd generation of ownership.
