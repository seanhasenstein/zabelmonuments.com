      'It is always a good idea to pre-plan your memorial. By doing so, all of your thoughts and wishes can be conveyed. It also takes the burden off of your survivors wondering what you would have wanted. The consultation is often more light hearted also. Upon the purchase, the memorial is engraved and placed into the cemetery or location of your choosing. When a death occurs, we go out to the memorial and engrave the date on site.',

    a:
      'About half of the cemeteries that we service have restrictions regarding the size of memorial that is installed. It is best to discuss this with the cemetery manager before you buy the property. We hear quite often, “I didn’t know I could not have a bigger stone. Why didn’t someone tell me about that?” Even though we might have restrictions to work within, rest assured we can still design a special individualized memorial.',

    q: 'Do I need a marker if the deceased is not going to a cemetery?',
    a:
      'Yes, survivors still should have somewhere tangible to go and reflect. There are many creative options available. Consider placing a memorial bench in your backyard, a city park or the favorite golf course. Another option is planting a tree in memory of the person and placing a memorial rock by the bottom of the tree.',

      'No and there are two key reasons why. First, in order for us to take on the risk we would have to charge a fee for this and once you add that to the price you purchased on-line our retail price is almost always lower. Second, our insurance will not cover a monument that was not purchased from us so if it would come in damaged or is damaged during transit you are taking on all the risk.',
